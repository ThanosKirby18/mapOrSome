# mapOrSome

Advanced Java Topics

March 18, 2022

The purpose of this prject was to learn how to use the most basic commands of a new data type. We had to choose a data type and research how to implement 
it. The title mapOrSome is representative of how I tried to implement a map before I changed to trying a double linked list.

I worked on this assignment by myself with limited help from other people in my classroom.
